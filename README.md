# Embedded System Programming

This repository consists of a number of programs that can be built and run on [ZYBO Boards](https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/?setCurrencyId=1&sku=410-351-10&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6UkI63R-3lInasDmUOHKrdeHZ4aVjPKjoBFn27hNY82nV3INHNbDmnBoCzikQAvD_BwE) with touchscreen interface.

Please look at one of the following sub-directories for details on each program.
* [Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/Unbeatable_Tic_Tac_Toe)
* [Simon Says](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/Simon_Says)
* [Match the Cards](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/Match_the_Cards)
* [Clock](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/Clock)
* [GPIO Driver for Switches Buttons](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/GPIO_Driver_for_Switches_Buttons)
* [Time Driver](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/EmbeddedSystemProgramming/tree/main/Time_Driver)

These programs specialize in delving into the intricacies of low-level software development for embedded systems. Drivers are designed that establish seamless communication with hardware devices. A comprehensive set of knowledge and skills are demonstrated, including:
* Proficiency in compiling and executing programs on ZYBO boards.
* Adept familiarity with graphic routines.
* Demonstrated expertise in crafting driver code that interfaces effectively with hardware registers.
* Exceptional capability in producing high-quality and reusable C code.
* Profound ability to harness multiple interrupts to meet diverse timing constraints.
* Acquaintance with the design and implementation of sophisticated state machines.
* Skill in creating systems employing a split control and display code, a prevalent design pattern in embedded systems.
* Extensive experience in crafting complex recursive algorithms, exemplified by the creation of the Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe.
